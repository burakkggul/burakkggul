### Hi, I'm Burak ðŸ‘‹

I've been creating free and open source projects since 2019. I believe in releasing all my useful software products and knowledge into the wild so that everyone can benefit from them!


I am currently spending my free time on free and open source projects and all my other time providing private consultancy to pay bills. I aim to create free time for myself to contribute more to free and open source projects in the future.
