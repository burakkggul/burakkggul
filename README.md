### Hi, I'm Burak ðŸ‘‹

I've been creating free and open source projects since 2019. I believe in releasing all my useful software products and knowledge into the wild so that everyone can benefit from them!


I work as a software developer at Ã–zgÃ¼r YazÄ±lÄ±m A.Åž. and contribute to free and open source projects in my spare time. I aim to create free time for myself to contribute more to free and open source projects in the future.
